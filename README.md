# Check-GH-Repo-Size
A program to check the size of a GitHub repo before cloning.


Many a time before cloning a GitHub repository we might feel the need to check their repo size. While we could use the GitHub API to get a JSON object that has the size attribute, I thought it would be very handy and convenient to developers who work with a lot of repos on a daily basis. 

### This primarily for the from the AI community and Web development community as the resources and bundled materials are always increasing in size.
